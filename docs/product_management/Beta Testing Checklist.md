## Part II: List Issues and Recommendations

| Beta Planning Issue | Recommendation |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Potential AI token usage exceeding budget during peak usage periods | Implement dynamic token optimization that adjusts model complexity based on query type; establish token usage alerts at 75% of daily budget |
| Integration reliability with JIRA API during high-load periods | Develop queuing system for JIRA requests during peak times; negotiate higher API limits with Atlassian for launch period |
| User confusion about natural language capabilities and limitations | Create detailed onboarding guide with example prompts; implement suggested commands feature; add clear error messages for unsupported requests |
| Varying user expectations across different company sizes and team structures | Segment feedback analysis by company size and team structure; prioritize features that deliver value across segments; develop configurable workflows |
| Security concerns from enterprise participants about sensitive project data | Implement additional encryption for enterprise users; create whitepaper detailing security architecture; obtain security certification before full launch |
| Risk of inconsistent user experience across different development environments | Expand testing to cover additional edge cases; standardize core functionality behavior; create environment-specific documentation |
