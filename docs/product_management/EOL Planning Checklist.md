| **Communications Planning** | -  Has the Retirement Communication Management Plan been developed and implemented?-  Have all stakeholders validated the plan, including development teams, customers, and integration partners?-  Does the plan support both internal communications (to employees) and external communications (to customers and partners)? | |

In conclusion, our exploration of the EOL Plan transitions into a practical phase, formalizing requirements into an actionable checklist. This tool allows for a dynamic assessment of critical factors across product identification, rationale, retirement strategy, communication planning, internal and external impact, cost analysis, scheduling, risk analysis, and critical success factors.
