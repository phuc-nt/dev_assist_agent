# End-of-Life (EOL) Plan: DevAssist Bot

## Part II: End-of-life (EOL) plan

| EOL planning category | Planning considerations |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Product identification | -  Product name: DevAssist Bot-  Product SKUs: DevAssist Bot Standard ($15/user/month), DevAssist Bot Enterprise ($25/user/month)-  Impact on Product Mix: Retirement will leave gap in AI automation tools portfolio; evaluate migration path to next-generation developer productivity solution |
| Rationale | -  Market shift toward embedded AI capabilities within native JIRA and Slack platforms-  Increasing cost of AI token usage making current pricing model unsustainable-  Emergence of more advanced AI technology making current architecture obsolete-  Strategic decision to focus company resources on core developer tools rather than administrative automation |
| Retirement strategy | -  Implement phased retirement over 18 months-  Evaluate potential spin-off of technology to specialized AI automation company-  Consider harvest strategy by continuing minimal support for enterprise customers while phasing out new sales-  If full retirement selected, provide clear migration path to alternative solutions or next-generation product |
| Proposed mitigation plan | -  Phase 1 (Months 1-6): End of new feature development, announce retirement timeline-  Phase 2 (Months 7-12): End of new sales, continue supporting existing customers-  Phase 3 (Months 13-18): End of standard support, offer premium support for enterprise customers-  Phase 4 (Month 18+): Complete shutdown of services with data export options |
| Communications planning | -  Initial announcement: Email to all customers and partners 18 months before EOL-  Dedicated retirement portal with timeline, FAQ, and migration resources-  Quarterly email updates to all stakeholders on retirement progress-  Direct outreach to enterprise customers by account managers-  Developer community announcements via GitHub, Slack, and technical forums-  Final notification 90 days before service shutdown |
| Internal impact | -  **Operations**: Gradual decommissioning of cloud infrastructure and AI services-  **Customer Support**: Transition plan for support team with training on alternative solutions-  **Sales**: Commission structure adjustments for transition period, focus shift to replacement products-  **Human Resources**: Reallocation of development team to other products, potential job role changes-  **Legal**: Contract review for early termination implications, data retention compliance requirements |
| External impact | -  **Customers**: Data migration tools provided for all customers to export their settings and logs-  **Partners**: Early notification to integration partners (JIRA, Slack) about API deprecation-  **Alternative solutions**: Vetted list of alternative solutions with negotiated transition discounts-  **Migration assistance**: Documentation and support for moving to alternative solutions-  **Special considerations**: Extended support options for critical enterprise implementations |
| Cost analysis | -  **Cost savings**: $255,000 annual operational costs eliminated-  **Revenue impact**: Projected $4.5M revenue loss over three years if no replacement product-  **Transition costs**: $200,000 for migration tools, extended support, and customer communication-  **Net financial impact**: Cost/benefit analysis shows net positive financial impact if resources redirected to higher-growth products-  **Approval process**: Final retirement plan requires CEO, CTO, and Board approval with quarterly financial reviews during transition |
| Scheduling | -  **Announcement date**: January 15, 2028-  **End of new feature development**: January 15, 2028-  **End of new sales**: July 15, 2028-  **End of standard support**: January 15, 2029-  **Service shutdown**: July 15, 2029-  **Transition period**: 18 months total with quarterly milestone reviews |
| Risk analysis | -  **Customer retention risk**: 35% risk of losing customers to competitors during transition-  **Mitigation**: Proactive migration assistance and incentives for adopting replacement solutions-  **Reputation risk**: Potential negative market perception of abandoning developer community-  **Mitigation**: Clear communication about technology evolution and superior alternatives-  **Technical risk**: Data loss during migration process-  **Mitigation**: Comprehensive backup solutions and phased migration support-  **Competitive risk**: Competitors targeting our customer base during transition-  **Mitigation**: Special loyalty pricing for existing customers moving to our other products |
| Critical success factors (CSF) | -  **Customer migration rate**: 80% of customers successfully migrated to alternative solutions-  **Revenue retention**: 70% of recurring revenue retained through migration to other company products-  **Customer satisfaction**: Maintain 4.0/5.0 satisfaction rating throughout retirement process-  **Data integrity**: 100% of customer data successfully exported or securely deleted per preferences-  **Measurement plan**: Monthly tracking dashboard for all CSFs with executive review and adjustment of transition strategy as needed |
