## Part II: List Issues and Recommendations

| Launch Planning Issue | Recommendation |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Potential customer confusion about AI capabilities vs. limitations | Develop clear messaging that accurately represents AI capabilities without overpromising; create educational content explaining what the bot can and can't do |
| Security concerns from enterprise customers regarding AI access to sensitive data | Create detailed security whitepaper; obtain relevant security certifications; implement and promote enterprise security features including data encryption and role-based access controls |
| Possible technical issues during beta with API rate limits and service availability | Implement robust monitoring; establish clear escalation paths for critical issues; create redundancies for key integration points; develop fallback mechanisms for when APIs are unavailable |
| Risk of low engagement after initial trial period | Design an onboarding process that demonstrates immediate value; implement feature discovery prompts; create usage dashboards showing time saved; develop regular check-in communications |
| Competitive response from established players may impact launch momentum | Monitor competitor activities closely; prepare response strategies for potential competitive moves; emphasize unique differentiators; secure and publicize early customer testimonials |
| Scaling challenges if demand exceeds projections | Implement elastic infrastructure planning; prepare contingency staffing plan; prioritize system stability and performance; create waitlist mechanism if necessary while maintaining exceptional experience for existing users |
