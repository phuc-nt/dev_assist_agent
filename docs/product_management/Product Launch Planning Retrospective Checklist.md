## Part II: Conduct a Retrospective

| Question | Responses |
|----------|-----------|
| What went well? | -  Beta program exceeded expectations with 95% of participants reporting significant time savings-  Media coverage was extensive, with features in 12 tech publications exceeding our goal of 5-  Conversion rate from trial to paid reached 17%, above our 15% target-  Integration reliability with JIRA and Slack maintained 99.7% uptime, exceeding our 99.5% goal-  Customer support team demonstrated strong knowledge of the product and effectively handled initial questions | |
| What can we improve? | -  AI token usage during peak times exceeded budget by 15%, requiring rapid optimization-  Onboarding process confused some users about natural language capabilities and limitations-  Security documentation was completed later than planned, delaying some enterprise evaluations-  Sales team required additional training on technical aspects, slowing enterprise sales cycle-  Some customer expectations weren't properly managed regarding advanced AI capabilities | |
