# DevAssist Bot: Product Roadmap

## Vision and Strategic Objectives
Our vision is to create an AI-powered assistant that transforms how developers handle administrative tasks, allowing them to reclaim 5-10 hours weekly for productive coding. DevAssist Bot will seamlessly integrate with development tools, understand technical contexts, and automate routine workflows across platforms.

## Key Business Drivers
- Developer productivity crisis: 20-30% of development time spent on administrative tasks
- Growing AI adoption in technical workflows (67% of teams implementing AI assistants)
- Increasing integration needs between disparate development tools
- Rising costs of context switching (up to 23 minutes lost per interruption)
- Expanding market for developer productivity tools ($9.2B in 2024, 15% CAGR)
