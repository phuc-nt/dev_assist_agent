## Part II: List Readiness Issues and Recommendations

| Readiness Issue | Recommendation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| AI token usage monitoring systems may not be fully tested for scale | Implement stress testing of the cost management module with simulated high user loads; establish daily monitoring protocols and automated alerts for abnormal usage patterns |
| Integration reliability with JIRA and Slack APIs needs verification at scale | Conduct load testing with a minimum of 1,000 simultaneous operations; negotiate higher API rate limits with platform providers before launch; implement queuing system for requests during peak periods |
| Comprehensive documentation for enterprise security configurations is incomplete | Prioritize completion of security whitepapers and compliance documentation; create detailed guides for enterprise security setup with role-based access controls and data encryption options |
| Sales team lacks experience with AI-based developer tools | Schedule dedicated training sessions for sales team focusing on developer workflows and pain points; develop concise ROI calculation tools and case studies demonstrating productivity gains |
| Customer support team needs better preparation for AI-specific troubleshooting | Create a specialized AI troubleshooting guide with common error scenarios and resolutions; establish an escalation path for complex AI behavior issues; train support staff on interpreting AI token usage and optimization |
| Potential confusion about AI capabilities vs. limitations among early users | Develop clear onboarding guides showing specific use cases and limitations; create in-app prompts that guide users toward successful interactions; prepare FAQ documentation addressing common misconceptions |
| Third-party security audits and penetration testing incomplete | Expedite engagement with security auditors to complete assessment at least 30 days before launch; allocate emergency resources to address any critical findings |
