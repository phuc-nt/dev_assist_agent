# Market Requirements Document (MRD): DevAssist Bot

## 1. Market Segment

-  **Targeted Market Segment:**
   - Software development companies and teams that rely heavily on JIRA and Slack for project management
   - Technology startups with limited administrative support but high development workload
   - Enterprise IT departments with agile development practices
   - Companies that prioritize developer productivity and aim to reduce administrative overhead
   - Organizations with distributed or remote development teams requiring streamlined communication

-  **Specific Buyers and Users:**
   - **Primary Users:** Software developers and programmers (ages 25-40) who spend significant time on administrative tasks
   - **Secondary Users:** Project managers, Scrum Masters, and Product Owners (ages 30-45) who coordinate team activities
   - **Decision Makers:** CTOs and technical directors (ages 35-55) focused on improving team efficiency and resource allocation
   - **Influencers:** DevOps leaders and engineering managers seeking to optimize development workflows

## 2. Market Problem

-  **Market Problem:**
   - Software developers spend approximately 20-30% of their working time on administrative and project management tasks instead of coding and development
   - Context switching between development environments and management tools (JIRA, Slack) significantly reduces productivity and focus
   - Manual updates to project management systems are error-prone and inconsistently performed
   - Current automation solutions are fragmented, requiring separate configurations for each platform
   - Existing chatbots and automation tools lack understanding of software development context and terminology
   - The cognitive load of managing multiple administrative tasks creates developer fatigue and reduced job satisfaction
   - Time spent on administrative tasks directly translates to delayed project timelines and increased development costs

## 3. Market Requirements

-  **Market Requirements:**

   **Functional Requirements:**
   - Must integrate with JIRA to create, update, search, and assign tickets without leaving development environment
   - Must integrate with Slack to send messages, create threads, and search conversation history
   - Must understand natural language instructions related to software development terminology and workflows
   - Must automate routine status updates across platforms based on development activities
   - Must provide a unified interface for managing tasks across multiple platforms
   - Must support cross-platform workflows (e.g., creating JIRA tickets from Slack conversations)
   - Must offer customizable automation workflows based on team preferences
   - Must generate summaries of development activities and administrative tasks completed
   
   **Non-functional Requirements:**
   - Security: Must implement enterprise-grade security protocols and comply with data protection regulations
   - Performance: Must respond to user queries within 2 seconds and maintain 99.5% uptime
   - Usability: Must provide an intuitive interface requiring minimal training for developers
   - Scalability: Must support teams of various sizes (5-500+ developers)
   - Cost Efficiency: Must optimize AI token usage to keep operational costs predictable
   - Integration Capability: Must use standard APIs and provide extension points for additional tools
   - Reliability: Must provide clear confirmation of actions taken and error handling
   - Accessibility: Must be available via web interface, Slack integration, and potentially IDE plugins
